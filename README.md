### 👋 Hi, I'm a Web Developer


I'm a front-end web developer with a strong focus on building **clean**, **responsive**, and **user-friendly interfaces** using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. I specialize in **React**, but I'm also eager to explore and work with other libraries and frameworks to continuously expand my skill set. I create interactive, component-based web applications that are **performance-optimized** and **SEO-friendly**.

### 🛠️ What I Do

- Build modern front-end solutions with **React**, **HTML5**, **CSS3**, and **JavaScript**.
- Explore and adapt to other libraries and frameworks beyond React to broaden my skill set
- Apply **SEO best practices** to improve visibility and performance
- Transform **UI/UX designs** from **Figma** and **Adobe** into responsive and accessible front-end experiences
- Collaborate with **cross-functional teams** to create cohesive and consistent digital products

### 🌍 Open to Opportunities

I'm open to both **remote** and **on-site** roles — in **Nigeria** or **internationally**. I'm passionate about joining teams where I can contribute to meaningful projects and continue to grow as a developer.
